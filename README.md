This repository contains all the documentation relative to the nutella framework. It is meant for developers of the framework, not their users. It is of course a work-in-progress and so far we have covered the following.

* *[nutella protocol](protocol/index.md)* A description of the APIs that nutella exposes to people designing nutella-based applications together with a complete rundown of all the messages that are exchanged by the framework pieces.
* *[installing the framework](getting_started/index.md)* Guide to framework installation
* *[create your first app tutorial](getting_started/tutorial_1.md)* Tutorial that explains how to create your first nutella application.
