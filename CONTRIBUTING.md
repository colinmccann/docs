# Contributing 
First of all, thank you! If you are reading this, we love you already because you want to help and you deserve a smiling cat. :smile_cat: nutella is a project still in its infancy and we definitely need more hands to help make it great! Any help is welcome so don't be shy!

## How do I report a bug?
The first way you can help us is by **reporting bugs [here](https://github.com/nutella-framework/nutella_framework/issues)** or getting in touch with us on Gitter.

## Getting around
If you are trying to get a general idea of what we are working on at the moment, probably the best place to look is our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/mR1RRxls).

The other thing you might want to check out is our [architecture overview]() that explains what each component in the framework does and how they interact among each other. This is like the [map of the world at the beginning of any fantasy novel](http://jademphillips.com/2012/12/05/creating-a-map-for-your-fantasy-novel/): it will help you figure things out and follow along. 

## But I just want to fix a bug!
Go for it! Just send a pull request to the right repo and we'll try to merge it as soon as we can
