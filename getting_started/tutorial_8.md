In order to prepare our applicaiton to be delivered to students and teachers in the classroom we need to package up our two interfaces so that they can be accessed using RoomCast. In order to do this we are going to use two tools provided by nutella: RoomCast channel creator and package creator.

## Creating channels
Let's start and launch channel creator. Your scree should look something like this

As you see we have no channels yet. Channels are bascially the way nutella specifies an interface must be available to students and teachers. As you have seen, so far we had access to all interfaces via main interface. However, we don't want kids and teachers to tinker with all these controls but we want a way for them to only see what they need to see, that is channels.

## Creating channel packages
Once we have created our three channels we need to decide who can see what. In order to do this we need to use the package creator interface.
